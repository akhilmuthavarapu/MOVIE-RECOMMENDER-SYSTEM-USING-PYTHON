# MOVIE-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM-USING-PYTHON
Movie Recommender System with Streamlit App
This project implements a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering in Python and showcases the recommendations along with movie posters in a Streamlit web application.
Features

    Recommends movies to users based on collaborative filtering techniques.
    Displays recommended movie posters in a user-friendly Streamlit web app.

Technologies Used

    Python
    Streamlit
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn
    IMDbPY (for fetching movie posters)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/akhilmuthavarapu/movie-recommender.git
    cd movie-recommender

Install the required dependencies:
